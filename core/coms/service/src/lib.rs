//! Service is one of the unit types supported in sysmaster. Service is used to pull up services and manage them.
//! The service configuration file contains three sections: Unit, Socket, and Install.
//!
//! # Example:
//! ``` toml
//! [Unit]
//! Description="test service"
//! Documentation="test.service"
//!
//! [Service]
//! Type="Simple"
//! ExecCondition="/usr/bin/sleep 5"
//! ExecStartPre="/usr/bin/sleep 5"
//! ExecStart="/bin/echo 'test'"
//! ExecStop="/bin/kill $MAINPID"
//!
//!
//! [Install]
//! WantedBy="dbus.service"
//! ```
//! [Service] section related configuration
//!
//! Type
//!
//! The service type configuration field currently supports simple, forking, oneshot, and notify The default value is simple when not configured.
//!
//! The simple mode indicates that the service startup is completed when the fork sub process succeeds.
//! The forking mode indicates that when the fork sub process exits, the service startup is completed. The pid of the sub process needs to be obtained through PIDFile.
//! The oneshot mode exits after the service is executed.
//! Notify the status message to the sysmaster after the notify mode service is started.
//! Supported notification messages MAINPID=$val, READY=$val, STOPPING=$val, ERRNO=$val
//!
//!
//! ExecCondition, ExecStartPre, ExecStart, ExecStop, ExecStartPost
//!
//! The commands that a service needs to execute at different startup stages support configuring multiple commands division. For example, "/usr/bin/sleep 5;/bin/echo 'test'".
//!
//! PIDFile
//!
//! When the Type field is forking, you need to configure this field to obtain the PID of the child process
//!
//! RemainAfterExit
//!
//! Support the configuration of true and false. When the configuration is true, the service is still considered as active after exiting. The default configuration is false.
//!
//! NotifyAccess
//!
//! The support configuration is main, which means that the notification sent by the MAINPID process is supported.
//!
//! Environment
//!
//! The environment variable parameter passed to the child process can be configured with more than one The configuration format is "key=value".
//!
//! Sockets
//!
//! Indicates the socket service that the current service depends on. The dependency is Wants. Support multiple configurations, and use ";" when configuring multiple division.
